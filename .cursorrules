Key Principles

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.

Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.

TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.
